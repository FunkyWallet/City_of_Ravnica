        <p><strong>Composting & Household Hazadous Waste Collection:</strong><br>Many homes in Ravnica might generate small quantities of hazardous waste, such as magical residues or expired potions. We would provide a safe disposal service for these materials to protect both the environment and residents. Golgari would offer curbside pickup of organic waste for homeowners, making it convenient to dispose of kitchen scraps and yard debris. They would then transform this waste into compost, which residents could use to enrich their gardens or donate back to the Golgari for use in the fungal gardens.</p>

        <h1><strong>Join Us!</strong></h1>
        <p>We frequently arrange and lead community cleanup events in partnership with local businesses and residents. These events foster a sense of civic responsibility and environmental stewardship while beautifying the city and diverting waste from improper disposal. We also establish educational programs for schools and local organizations, teaching children and community members about the importance of waste reduction, composting, and responsible waste disposal. These programs instill a sense of environmental consciousness from an early age.</p>
